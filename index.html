            Los Angeles ... a place unique to the world with no ceiling on success. Where people go to turn their dreams into tangible manifestations. That's where I've been for the last 12 years, accomplishing just that. I'm a huge success. I act in surreal, thought-piece movies that change the way people see the world. When I release a new song it gets millions of streams within the first few hours, across multiple platforms. I'm working on a novel, writing a new screenplay, have my own line of Kombucha, alkaline water, ironic t-shirts, serious shoes, biodegradable hats made from post consumer waste, and a great tasting fair trade organic Mexican coffee brand. I have upwards of a hundred million dollars, a beautiful wife, two kids, a house on Mullholland, and one in "The 'Bu". However my wife lives in Calabasas ... because the schools are better for the kids, not because we can't stand each other.</p>

            Oh ... wait a second, none of that is true. Most of my time in LA (and Oakland) was spent spinnig my wheels, going on auditions, playing shows that nobody went to, working for bigshots who payed as if they were destitute, dealing with collaborators who were lazy and riddled with drugs, and struggling just to pay the rent and eat. Of course that excludes the time in which I squatted in a warehouse for a few months ... I dind't have to pay rent then.

            In the end I put what I was passionate about on the back burner and got a job as a computer repair tech in Hollywood so that I could have a (slightly) better quality of life ... a story in a book as old as time with a billion pages. I don't know where my story ends, but becoming another page in that book ain't it.
